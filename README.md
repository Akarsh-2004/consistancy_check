## 🌑 Core Philosophy: The "Mature Dark" Aesthetic
Unlike neon-heavy or overly simplistic apps, LifeOS utilizes a **Midnight Matte & Slate** design system.
- **Typography:** Philosophical headers using **Crimson Pro** (Serif) paired with data-driven **Inter** (Sans).
- **Interactions:** Subtle, intentional transitions and animations that focus your attention rather than distracting it.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ⏱️ Persistent Deep Work Session (Pomodoro+)
A dynamic focus timer built for deep work.
- **Dynamic Duration:** Set your own focus blocks (1–180 minutes).
- **Navigation Persistence:** The timer follows you across pages (Dashboard, Settings, etc.) without resetting, allowing for a seamless work session.

### 📊 Advanced Analytical Dashboard
High-level data visualization to track your evolution.
- **Life Balance Index:** A Radar chart correlating Mood, Efficiency, Journaling, Habits, and Task completion.
- **Weekly Executive Summary:** Structured feedback on your performance, velocity, and focus areas.

### 📜 Daily Wisdom & Reflections
- **Daily Quotes:** A deterministic rotation of insights from history's most disciplined minds in the header.
- **Historical Snapshots:** A calendar-based archive where you can revisit any day's mood, journal entries, and completed disciplines.
